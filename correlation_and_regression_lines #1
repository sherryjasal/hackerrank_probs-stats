Objective 
In this challenge, we practice calculating the correlation between two elements.
Task 
For a particular scatter plot, the line of regression of  on  is:
3x+4y+8 = 0

And the line of regression of  on  is:
4x+3y+7 = 0

Find the Pearson Product moment coefficient, , correct to a scale of decimal places.


y = -3/4x-8/4
x = -3/4y-7/4

r^2 = bxy * byx = (-3/4)*(-3/4) = 9/16
Pearson Correlation (r) = -3/4 = -0.75 which means its negatively correlated
