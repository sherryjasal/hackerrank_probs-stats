Objective 
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability.
Task 
In a single toss of  fair (evenly-weighted) 6-sided dice, find the probability of that their sum will be at most .

Total Events: 36
At most sum 9 meaning evertything less than equal to sum 9
So total events are 36-6 = 30
prob = 30/36 = 5/6
