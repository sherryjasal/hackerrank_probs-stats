Objective 
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability.
Task 
A firm produces steel pipes in three plants.
Plant A produces 500 units per day and has a fraction defective output of 0.005 
Plant B produces 1000 units per day and has a fraction defective output of 0.008 
Plant C produces 2000 units per day and has a fraction defective output of 0.010
At random, a pipe is selected from the dayâ€™s total production and it is found to be defective. What is the probability that it came from plant A ?

So probability of getting 
Defective output from Plant A = 0.005*500 = 2.5
Defective output from Plant B = 0.008*1000 = 8
Defective output from Plant C = 0.010*2000 = 10

So total defective outputs = 30.5
The probability of getting defective output from Plant A = 2.5/30.5 = 5/61
