Objective 
In this challenge, we practice calculating the slope of regression lines.
Task 
There are 2 series of data involving index numbers: P for price index and S for the commodity stock. 
The mean and standard deviation of P are 100 and 8, respectively.
The mean and standard deviation of S are 103 and 4, respectively. 
The  correlation coefficient between the two series is 0.4.
With this data, obtain the slope of the regression line of P on S, correct to a scale of 2 decimal places.

Y = a+bX
slope of regression line is which is b = r * (s.d. of x)/(s.d. of y) = 
                                     b = root(0.4)*(8/4)
                                     b = 1.2648 which is the slope of regression line
