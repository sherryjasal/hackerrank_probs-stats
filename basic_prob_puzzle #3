Objective 
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability.
Task 
There are 3 urns: X , Y and Z.
Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.
One ball is drawn from each urn. What is the probability that the  balls drawn consist of 2 red balls and 1 black ball?

So total combinations of 3 Urns : 8
(RRR) (RRB) (RBR) (BRR) (BBR) (BRB) (RBB) (BBB)

So the combination for 2 red balls and 1 black ball will be:
(RRB) - 4/7*5/9*4/8 = 10/63
(RBR) - 4/7*4/9*4/8 = 8/63
(BRR) - 3/7*5/9*4/8 = 5/42

Total = 10/63+8/63+5/42 = 17/42
