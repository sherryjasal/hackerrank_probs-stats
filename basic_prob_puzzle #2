Objective 
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability.
Task 
For a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and their sum is 6.

Total events = 36
Events with different values = 4
So probability will be = 4/36 = 1/9
